NEW FEATURES

- Files can now be edited (captions, categories, depiction)!
- Search results in the search tab are now sortable by newest/oldest results

PERFORMANCE AND BUG FIXES

- Images are now cached for longer and loaded more efficiently when many images are displayed in a short time.

OTHER

Images are now client-side rate-limited to 10 images per 10 seconds, as Commons recently implemented stricter rate limiting on the backend.
Unfortunately, there are still a few issues, which are causing an increased number of image loading errors because the app is classified as a bot in the backend and is only allocated limited request resources. I am currently working with the responsible parties to resolve this issue.

LICENSE

CommonsFinder is now licensed under the GPLv3.0!
