Support for iOS 18 restored!

If you use iOS 18, you will now continue to enjoy the new features, fixes and adjustments of the last weeks and the coming weeks and months.

However, the future focus will rather be on iOS 26, especially the uploading of files in the background is essential for batch/multi-uploads (as soon as I get to build the feature ;)

That means, there may be a few rougher corners here and there with iOS 18 than in previous versions, since I can't always test all features and UI elements in parallel.
