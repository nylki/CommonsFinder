New this week: Upload-Flow Improvements

- info about missing required fields when tapping the greyed-out upload button
- validate and sanitize filenames before upload
- when an upload did fail, you can now see more details about the issue
- failed uploads can now be resumed or retried (depending on the type of error)
- smaller UI styling adjustments in a few places

Thanks everybody who send feedback, much appreciated!
