This release features bigger changes to the map making,
making it more useful and hopefully also more intuitive.
This is just one iteration on Map features, expect finetuning and more bigger features to come! :)

MAP
- new Tab-Icon for consistency
- images and categories can now be shown on the map (via context menu or small inline map in the detail views)
- when you long press on an empty location on the map, you will now be presented with items in a 250m radius around that coordinate that you pressed
- split location (categories/wikidata items) and images into 2 separate map layers that can be switched
- highlighted items on the map now have labels
- clusters are now positioned by center of density instead purely by their mathematical center, making the cluster button positioned more naturally
- a selected cluster now has the boundary-outline instead of a radius, which better reflects the geometry and density of items in a cluster
- clusters with only 1 item show that item with its image directly on the map
- the map sheet is now using the native sheet-model implementation which has some upsides, but also some gotchas.
- the map sheet now indicates the (rough) address/location of a cluster of items
- when opening a category/map location in another app, the system-wide default app for navigation will now be opened (eg. Organic Maps instead of Apple Maps), this may be an iOS 26 or EU-only feature, not 100% sure.


OTHER CHANGES
- add pluralization in some places
- some smaller label and icon adjustments in menus
