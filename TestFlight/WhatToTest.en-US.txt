hi! new this week:

Map:
you can now switch between standard and satellite map imagery

Upload/Draft View

- the image preview now opens the full zoom viewer and doesn't hover above (and obstruct) the input fields.

Networking (infrastructure):

-removed Alamofire dependency (results less maintenance complexity and smaller app bundle size)
