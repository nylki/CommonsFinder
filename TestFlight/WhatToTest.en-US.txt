Heya! This release brings a few new features and changes :)

# Bookmarks

Files and categories can now be bookmarked for later.
These will then appear in the home view, which has also received some UI adjustments.

# Tag Suggestions in the Upload Flow

If an image contains GPS coordinates, relevant categories may now be suggested automatically.
If the camera direction is included in the EXIF data, this will also be used to filter the suggestions even further.
This means categories that could be within the camera’s field of view will be suggested more.

# Bug Fixes

- coordinates of uploaded images now include proper accuracy/precision values

- camera direction (bearing) values are now normalized (e.g., -10° is now shown as 350°)

- various other fixes

# Next steps

- After this somewhat larger update, I’ll try to keep the next ones a bit smaller and focused.
Here are a few things I want to look into next:

- More robust uploads (duplicate filename checks, background uploads, better error messages, etc.)

- iOS 26 adjustments for the new UI

- Improved search (searching for categories and users, search term suggestions)

The map will also be improved, though probably not until the items above are taken care of.

Have fun testing and using the app! :)
