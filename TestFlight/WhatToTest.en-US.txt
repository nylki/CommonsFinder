New this week:

- Search within categories

- Include subcategories for image list and search inside categories

- Potentially improved image loading behavior (referrer header added; see Phabrikator ticket T413570)

- Remember the last map base layer when the app is closed (satellite/default)

- Added a few missing German translations

Last week, there were major changes to the upload process to make it more robust.

Thanks to all the testers! <3
