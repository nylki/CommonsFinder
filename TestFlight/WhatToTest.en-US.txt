New this week: Upload-Flow Improvements

- info about missing required fields when tapping the greyed-out upload button
- validate and sanitize filenames before upload
- when an upload did fail, you can now see more details about the issue
- failed uploads can now be resumed or retried (depending on the type of error)
- smaller UI styling adjustments in a few places

This set changes should make uploads more robust, easier to reason about and easier to recover from failed uploads.

Known Issue:
The original fullsized image sometimes fails to load when opening the zoom viewer.
This is partly due to a change on the backend and there is a tentative fix (adding a referer header to requests),
but needs further discussion. See Phabrikator-Ticket T413570.

Thanks everybody who send feedback, much appreciated!
