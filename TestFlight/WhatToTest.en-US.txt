changes this week:

- feature: upload a new image directly from a Category detail view
- fix wrong map selection in some situations
- tweak map item density
- on app start, position the map at the user location instead of a zoomed out continents view (if location access was previously granted)
- new and tweaked icons in some context menus

Last week's update contained big map changes and a crash fix for uploads on iOS 26.
